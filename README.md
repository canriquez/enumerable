## Live Demo

## Getting Started

You can use the Repl.it link above to test the functionalities of the sorting method we created. 


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
    - You need to have ***Ruby*** installed on your machine ([Check this out](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for instructions on installing ruby)

### Usage
    To run the code go to the local folder where you have the *Ruby file* and run in the terminal `$ ruby file.rb` being 'file' the one you want to run

### Run tests
    - On the first method (`:bubble_sort`) you can change the given array where you call the method (just after the method definition).
    - On the second one (`:bubble_sort_by`) you can change the words inside the array (remember to separate them with spaces).
