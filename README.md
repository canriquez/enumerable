# Advanced Building Blocks - Enumerables

> In this project, the requirement is to implement my own version of Ruby‚Äôs enumerable methods. 
Implemented methods are as follow:
- 1. #my_each
- 2. #my_each_with_index
- 3. #my_select
- 4. #my_all?
- 5. #my_any?
- 6. #my_none?
- 7. #my_count
- 8. #my_map
- 9. #my_inject
- 10.#my_inject: Using #my_inject to build #multiply_els method
- 11.#my_map method, modification to take procs
- 12.#my_map refactoring so it takes procs and blocks
Each method is tested within the same code, after module definition.

## Built With

- Ruby
- VSCode

## Live Demo

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/canriquez/enumerable)](https://repl.it/github/canriquez/enumerable)


## Getting Started

You can use the Repl.it link above to test the functionalities of the sorting method we created. 


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
    - You need to have ***Ruby*** installed on your machine ([Check this out](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for instructions on installing ruby)

### Usage
    To run the code go to the local folder where you have the *Ruby file* and run in the terminal `$ ruby file.rb` being 'file' the one you want to run

### Run tests
    - On the first method (`:bubble_sort`) you can change the given array where you call the method (just after the method definition).
    - On the second one (`:bubble_sort_by`) you can change the words inside the array (remember to separate them with spaces).
